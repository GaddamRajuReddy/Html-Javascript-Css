The div should be used to wrap sections of a document, while use spans to wrap small portions of text, images, etc
div accepts align attribute.but span not


************** local storage vs session storage ***************

Only strings can be stored with localStorage or sessionStorage, but you can use JSON.stringify to store more complex objects and JSON.parse to read them

session storage:
The sessionStorage exists only within the current browser tab. Another tab with the same page will have a different session storage.
when close the tab session will ended
In session storage can store 5mb offline data.
gets cleared only through JavaScript, or clearing the Browser cache / Locally Stored Data

sessioStorage.setItem(key, 'Value');
sessioStorage.getItem(key);
sessionStorage.removeItem('key');
sessionStorage.clear();



local storage:
Data is shared between all tabs and windows from the same origin.
The data will not expire. It will remain even after browser restart
In Local storage can store 5-10mb offline data.
gets cleared only through JavaScript, or clearing the Browser cache / Locally Stored Data

localStorage.setItem(key, 'Value');
localStorage.getItem(key);
localStorage.removeItem(key);
localStorage.clear();

Cookies: Cookies are data, stored in small text files as name-value pairs, on your computer. 
Cookies are primarily for server-side reading, it has expiration set by server side

********************* what are block and inlin elements******************

A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available 

ex: div, table, p, footer, header, nav , ol 

An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary.
An inline element cannot contain a block-level element!

ex: apan, i , img, br, b, textarea, select, abbr,




******************** why semantic elements *************************

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, hader, footer, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

HTML5 semantic tags define the purpose of the element. By using semantic markup, you help the browser understand 
the meaning of the content instead of just displaying it. By providing this extra level of clarity, HTML5 semantic 
elements also help search engines to read the page and find the required information faster.



***************** use of hyper link *******************

The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.
The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

An unvisited link is underlined and blue
A visited link is underlined and purple
An active link is underlined and red


*************************how can i make list and which tag can i use? ******************


An unordered list starts with the <ul> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.
An ordered list starts with the <ol> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.
